When you install opencv_contrib on Windows, follow this link. This is great solution.

When you confront an error contains '~ Old Behaviors ~', I recommend you delete opencv already installed, and change opencv version.
In my case, the version was 3.3.1.
And I also recommend you when you follow the upper link process, before doing 3., do Build with EXTRA MODULES earlier.

I also link my korean document for this issue.
