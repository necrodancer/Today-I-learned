# Text in the matplotlib plot
Usually, `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` are enough for your plot. <br>
However, sometimes you may want to insert text into your plot. <br>
Matplotlib provides some sample codes [here](
https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/text/text_intro.html
) to insert text in the plot. <br>
Please refer to it. <br>
