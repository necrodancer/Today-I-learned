# __main__
For one codebase(`.py`), <br>
The codes below enables to run `main()` method in the codebase. <br>
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Code that you want to run
```
If the codebase is a module and you want to test it, <br>
you can run `main()` in the module. <br><br>

The reason why I post this simple codes is that I always forget them when I create a new codebase.
