3minute Deep learning, ch 5 Tensorboard.

Tensorboard give us a web page to see our model's current situation in visualized manner.
In source code, tf.name_scope is used to name each layer and variables in tensorboard.
Make a directory for training log.
During training, record summaries of variables to see.
And type instruction to terminal, and get tensorboard page address. And check the result.

Tensorflow serving is a powerful service to implement our model to real business service.
