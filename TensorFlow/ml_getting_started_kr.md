# ML Getting Started KR ver from Tensorflow official site
### Intro
Today is Feb. 6th, 2018. I found the tutorial of tensorflow has quite changed.<br>
It recently provides high-level api, `tf.Estimator`.<br>
So I'm studying and translating [Getting Started for ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started_for_beginners) in Korean.<br>
After this work, I am going to try to study [Getting Started with Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/premade_estimators) also.<br>
### The translated document

### Error occured
Since my tf version is 1.2.0, I think it doesn't fit on this tutorial.<br>
`premade_estimator.py` is not working. It raised `no module has attribute 'keras'` even though I installed tensorflow and keras both!<br>
During this week, since my current work, tf version will be remained this week.<br>
After this week, I might try this document again.<br>
