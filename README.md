# Today-I-learned
## Introduction
Upload TIL. TIL(Today I learned) is commiting something that I learned new.
It was inspired from **[JayJin's TIL](https://github.com/milooy/TIL)** and **[thoughtbot til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).**
## How to commit
>1. A few sentences + example code explaining concepts, sintax, commands, or tips I've learned today.
>2. .md file + @(.ipynb file or etc.)
>3. Do not abuse with no meaning commits.
>4. The core is to study and program for myself.
